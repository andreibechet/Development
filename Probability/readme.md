The repository consists of code for basic probability ditributions


1. Bernoulli Distribution

Such a distribution is useful for modelling outcomes of processes which ask the question of Success of Failure.
The process has only two outcomes. This can be then used for answering the following questions :

A. Is the kid going to be a boy or a girl
B. Does the man have cancer or not
C. Is this a cat or a dog ?
D. Is the transmitted bit 0 or 1

The Bernoulli distribution needs only one paramter, called the probability of success, which is denoted by 'p'.

The probability mass function for the Bernoulli distribution is given as :

P(X = x) = p^x(1-p)^(1-x) for x = {0,1}
E[X] = p
Var[X] = p(1-p)
